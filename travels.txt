In 2019, I took 14 trips.  12 out of 14 trips were for dance trainings and immersions.
I love to go to new countries to study styles of Dance.
Last year, I spent 6 weeks in Western Europe studying bachata and kizomba.
In the USA, I go on weekenders to take dance classes and sight see.
I have adapted to the pandemic and stying home.  My bank account likes seeing money grow.
